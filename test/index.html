	<p>My mother is Nyonya (someone who is a mix of Malay and Chinese), so was my grandmother, and my great grandmother. So I guess I am Nyonya too. I’m very proud of it because it comes with a rich history of not just the Chinese people’s migration and intermarriage, but also the rich cuisine of the Nyonya people. </p>

	<p>There are so many delicious dishes in Nyonya cuisine, but my favourite has got to be <em> kari ayam </em>(Malaysian chicken curry). It is a hearty dish and goes so well with rice or roti canai (a type of Indian flatbread). Like most dishes originating from Malaysia, kari ayam represents the cultural melting pot of Malaysia, where it is a mix of Malay, Chinese, and Indian cuisines.</p>
